A collection of changes for an  HTML dev server.

Through the years i have been working as a php/html developer, i was in need for a quick n dirty development server, with LAMP  to use as a test environment for my work.

Needless to say i have been rebuilding such servers often enough, so this is a repository of monitored changes, things i shouldnt forget to on a new Debian headless installation
